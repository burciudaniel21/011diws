      "ingredients": "\n350g plain flour plus extra for rolling,\n 2 tsp baking powder,\n 2 tsp mixed spice,\n 250g golden caster sugar,\n 3 eggs, beaten,\n coarsely grated zest 1 orange,\n 85g raisin,\n85g dried cherry,\n50g blanched almond,\n50g shelled pistachio",
      "ingredientsOunce": "\n12.34oz plain flour plus extra for rolling,\n 2 tsp baking powder,\n 2 tsp mixed spice,\n 8.81oz golden caster sugar,\n 3 eggs, beaten,\n coarsely grated zest 1 orange,\n 2.99oz raisin,\n2.99oz dried cherry,\n1.76oz blanched almond,\n1.76oz shelled pistachio",
      "instructions": "STEP 1\n Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\n Line 2 baking sheets with baking paper. Put the flour, baking powder, spice and sugar in a large bowl, then mix well. Stir in the eggs and zest until the mixture starts forming clumps, then bring the dough together with your hands – it will seem dry at first but keep kneading until no floury patches remain. Add the fruit and nuts, then work them in until evenly distributed.\n\nSTEP 2\n Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. With lightly floured hands, roll each piece into a sausage about 30cm long. Place 2 on each tray, well spaced apart. Bake for 25-30 mins until the dough has risen and spread and feels firm. It should still look pale. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack for a few mins until cool enough to handle, then turn down the oven to 140C/fan 120C/gas 1.\n\nSTEP 3 \nUsing a bread knife, cut into slices about 1cm thick on the diagonal, then lay the slices flat on the baking sheets. The biscuits can be cooled and frozen flat on the sheet at this point, then bagged and frozen for up to 2 months. Bake for another 15 mins (20 mins if from frozen), turn over, then bake again for another 15 mins until dry and golden. Tip onto a wire rack to cool completely, then store in an airtight tin for up to one month, or pack into boxes or cellophane bags if giving as gifts straightaway.",

Gently press on top of dough to help seal together. \n\nSTEP 4\nRemove top parchment paper and trim sides to match up evenly. Starting on a long side, use the bottom parchment paper to help roll dough tightly in to a log. Roll log on the counter a few times to help seal the edge. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. \n\nSTEP 5\nPreheat oven to 180°C (160ºC fan). Line 2 large baking trays with parchment paper. Place sprinkles on a medium plate. Using a sharp knife, slice cookies 1.5-cm thick and roll edges in sprinkles.
